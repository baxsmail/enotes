## User Process and Kernel Process

* all user processes associated with kernel thread
* but there are some k. threads with not associated user process

## stack issue

* in user process, getting a interrupt, stack will store all reegisters

## Threads ( general )

* process can be heavy ( esp. in memory protection issue )
* thread are a lighter weight process, sharing
	* memory
	* open file
	* signals
* each thread has its own stack and its own kernel stack

* An execution context sharing an address space

* kernel thread
	* thread running with kernel privlege

* user threads
	* thread running in user space

* Processes
	* An executing context with an address space
	* visible to & scheduled by kernel

* Light-weight Process ( overlapping with user thread )
	* An execution context sharing an address space
	* visible to & scheduled by kernel

## Dispatcher

* Duties
	* saving state into PCB
	* selecting a next process ( thread )
	* loading state on the selected process

## Scheduling

* pick next thread to run
	* aka. round robin scheduling
	* is round roblin fair or not
	* what `fairness` mean
* use alarm( timer ) interrupts to trigger
	* frequency of these interrupts
		* quantum - how long one process have a core

## Goals of CPU scheduling

* Fairness
* Efficiency of processor ( min overhead )
* responsiveness
	* max wait time on the ready queue
* balance of load among cores
* memory ( main & cache )
* priority ( not all processes are equal )
* throughtput 
	* time to process a page, for instance
* turn around time

## multi programmed OS

## multitasking

* switching around to create illusion a more core than reality

## Types of Scheduling

* time
* resource
	* CPUs, I/O, networks, etc.
