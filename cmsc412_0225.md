### solution for last question

* see last note

### deadlock

* four necessary conditions
	* mutual exlusion
	* hold & wait `->` block & wait for some resources
	* no preemption `->` can't take it away		
	* circular wait

* example to illustrate necessary but not sufficient
	we have R1 for 2 and R2 for 1
	* holding : A( R1 ); B( R1 ); C( R2 );
	* waiting : 		 B( R2 ); C( R1 );
	* A is not waiting for anything
	* Allocation matrix
		* ## A B C
		* R1 1 1 0
		* R2 0 0 1
	* Request matrix
		* ## A B C
		* R1 0 0 1
		* R2 0 1 0
	* Work 
		* R1 0
		* R2 0

* examples
	* Work is a vector at length m ( resources )
	* Finish is a vector at length n ( processors )
	* Allocation is a n * m matrix indications of what you currently have
	* Requests is an n * m matrix indications how much more each process read


```pascal
	case 1:
	Work = Available ( Work starts as the available resources you have )
	if Alloc[i,j] != 0 then Finish = false else Finish = true;

	case 2:
	find i s.t. Finish[i] = false & Request[i] <= W ( vector compare, aka. every single element is smaller or equal to the other )
		if no such i  goto  case 4;

	case 3:
	Work += Allocation[i]; Finish[i] = true; goto case 2;

	case 4:
	if Finish[i] = false for some i, system is deadlocked
```

### Get rid of deadlock

* terminate one by one until deadlock breaks
* release some resources
* hold one resource only at one time
* more on next time
