### Sharing Mem.
1. Pages can be shared 
	* several process share code and/or date
	* several pages can refer to the same page frame( the actual physical page in mem. )
	* given read only page, shareing is always safe
2. When write occurs, decide if still share or not 
	* copy on write
		* when shared page is written, a new page frame is created
		* writing process owns the new page frame
		* rest have the old
		* e.g.
			* P1: Page Dir -> page Fields -> Page Frames
			* P2: Page Dir -> page Fields -> Page Frames
		* Inverted Page Table
			* < pid, page #, offset >
3. What happen when process refers to any page that has no physical addr. ?
	* called a page fault
	* cause #1 `->` the first use of a page 
		* called demand page
		* OS allocates frame, fills it, updates mapping, resumes process
	* cause #2 `->` ref. to an invalid address
		* program is terminated & OS prints segmentation violation
	* cause #3 `->` reference to a page on disk ( not in mem )
	* cause #4 `->` copy on write
4. Win32
	* NOACCESS
	* READONLY
	* EXECUTE
	* EXECUTE_READ
	* EXEC_READ/WRITE
	* WRITE_COPY
	* EXECUTE_WRITE_COPY

5. HW View
	* Page Frame # (20)
	* Valid bit (1)
	* modify/dirty bit (1)
	* reference bit (1)
	* Protection affilities
		* set by OS and checked by software
		* read (1)
		* write (1)
		* execute (1)
	* clone( funs, stack );
		* kernel stack , esp , eip
